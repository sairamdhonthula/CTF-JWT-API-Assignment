## 📖 Overview
This repository contains my **Capture the Flag (CTF) Assignment** on **JWT Security Research** and **Secure API Implementation**.  
It demonstrates **common JWT vulnerabilities** through a PoC (Proof of Concept) and provides a **secure Flask-based API** as a mitigation example.  

The project has two main parts:
1. **JWT Attack Demo** → PoC for alg=none, weak secret brute-force, and RS256→HS256 key confusion.  
2. **Secure API** → Flask API implementing secure user registration, login with JWT, and profile access.
